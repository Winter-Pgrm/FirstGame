Level names should be 6 characters or less without red or blue qualifier. ex Level4
There should be an image with this name (name).bmp that will act as the collision map. ex Level4.bmp
These should be paired with two image files called (name)Blue.bmp and (name)Red.bmp ex Level4Blue.bmp and Level4Red.bmp
The red file is what displays when the player can pass through red, and blue is the opposite.

This level name is added at the top of the "LevelManger.c" file, and when you add a new level increase the level count.

For the collision colors the pixel (RGB from the edit colors) should be Red=255 Blue=0 Green=0 for red and Red=0 Blue=255 Green=0 for blue.

Levels should include:

A single(small) pixel with the RGB Red = 255, Blue = 255, Green = 150. This is the starting point for the player.
A single(small) pixel with the RGB Red = 255, Blue = 255, Green = 100. This is the end point of the level.

Checkpoints are made from lines covering the trigger area and will use the center of that area as the ground for the respawn point.
The checkpoint colors are R = 255, B = 255, Green = 200. 

These pixels will be pinkish.
